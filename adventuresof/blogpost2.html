							Where It All Began...
						</h2>
						<div class="post-content">
							The on-campus day was heavily involved around The Designed Alliance coaching mechanism whilst also including various ice breakers and team working exercises to allow each individual to become more comfortable with their teams. 
							<br>
							<br>
							On this day we were also informed on what the general specification was for the group project. I was initially very optimistic about this. I had built web and desktop applications for business purposes before and figured that, based on the relevancy to our jobs, the group project specification would be along the same lines. Oh boy was I wrong. This was very far from the truth. It was around early afternoon when he finally dropped the bomb shell that we would be required to develop nothing of this sort…. In fact, arguably something that couldn’t be any further away from this naive assumption. A game… we were asked to build a game…. Not just any game though, probably one of the hardest sorts of games. An adventure game! I immediately sunk into my chair. I had no experience building any sort of game, never mind something as complex as an adventure game. I didn’t even do so little as play many games. I definitely wouldn’t describe myself as an avid gamer.
							<br>
							<br>
							Later that day we were asked to note down the most ideal outcomes of our group project but on another sheet also note down the worst-case scenario. I was quick to begin suggesting all the possible reasons why this project could and, in my opinion would go wrong. This was all in the absence of being able to fathom any possible reason as to why in fact, it might not actually be so bad. After each team had formulated their idea of heaven and hell we were asked to place our sheets at opposite ends of the room with ideal being at one end and the nightmares being at the other. Whilst we did this we were also asked to read the comments that had been provided by each team and think about the reality of each situation happening, which comments actually seemed plausible and which we were most excited or most anxious about actually happening. I could definitely understand many of the negative comments but couldn’t grasp how people had even a remotely positive expectation of this experience. 
							<br>
							<br>
							Before I had much time to consider the positivity’s, the lecturer began metaphorically divided the room into 11 even segments (sections 0-10). Section 0 was right down by the nightmare comments with section 10 being at the upper end by the ideal comments. We were then asked to stand in a section that describe the confidence levels we possessed. 0 being “I have no confidence at all” and 10 being “I’ve never felt so confidence”. I’ll give you one guess as to where I cemented myself. Thankfully I wasn’t the only one stood here, I had to check with the guy stood next to me, “This is section 0, right?”. He replied with a yes as I felt a little sigh of relief that I wasn’t the only one feeling this pain. The lecturer turned to us and said “so, you guys in section 0, how do you feel?”. I replied with a brutally honest response “sh*t to be honest”. I turned around to glance at the comments in the nightmare section that was just behind. “I can just resonate with some of the comments here, things like ‘sh*t has hit the fan’ and ‘nothing is working’”. I explained that I had never done any game development before and that this would be an extremely steep learning curve for me. At least he understood the expectation before going into this, right? He said to me “look up at where the rest of your team are. You should be reassured that they aren’t all stood next you”. He was right. I looked around to see the rest of my team hovering around the 6 and 7 mark. Even one guy stood at the very end by the 8. There was no one stood in the 9 or 10 section so seeing that I had one of the most confident people on my team reassured me a little. He was either confident in his own abilities or completely oblivious to the mountainous task that stood ahead of us. Realising the others showcasing they are more confident that not definitely gave me confidence. It was infection. I even considered meeting them half way at one point, moving up to around the 3 mark. Not a revelation I know but it’s progress.
							<br>
							<br>
							The single most important thing I took away from that whole day is that, during a team exercise, I should always consider the expertise of the entire team before jumping to conclusions about my own abilities. I learnt that having confidence in my team can help boost my own self esteem and help drive myself into a more optimistic way of thinking. 
							If I am to succeed in a team assessment in future, particularly when faced with a challenge I have not faced before, I will need put trust in the ability of my team members. I will try to look at the situation with a “cup half full” attitude as opposed to “half empty”. I will have take on board the positive energy of others and harness that to inject enthusiasm into my work, encouraging myself to learn from those who have confidence. Only then will I allow myself to have confidence in my own ability hopefully leading to a state where I do not depend on the confidence of other to motivate myself to achieve great things. Maybe I have an underlying issue with leaving responsibility in the hands of others? Maybe I need to research into coping mechanism that I can employ which help me to have faith in the capability of those around me? All I know right now is that I ought to get better at this before it proves to be a bigger issue than I could ever have anticipated.
